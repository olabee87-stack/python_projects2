What is Numpy?

# It is a multidimensional
# It is faster than using lists, so it is fast
# Numpy used fixed types - hence it occupies lesser space than the lists
# Faster to read less bytes of memory
# Numpy uses contiguous memory but lists are scattered around, they are not next to each other.
# This causes longer memory lookups for lists


Differences
Lists: You can insert, delete, append and concat
NumPy: You can do all and lots more

Numpy
***********
- Can be used for Plotting(Matplotlib)
Mathematics(MATLAB replacement)
Backend(Pandas, Coneect 4, Digital Photography)
Machine learning applications eg Tensors which is similar to numpy
